# Currency Converter API

This is a simple Node.js application that provides a currency conversion API. It uses live exchange rates from a third-party API to convert between currencies.

---

## Features

- Converts an amount from one currency to another.
- Fetches live exchange rates using the ExchangeRate API.
- Built with **Express.js** and containerized using **Docker**.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (if running locally)
- **Docker** (if running as a container)
- ExchangeRate API key (get one from [ExchangeRate API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/)).
